# Simply Scheme

## Chapter 2: Functions

When they say 'function', they mean roughly what an algebra teacher means,
except that their functions aren't limited to working on numbers. But, in
a nutshell, functions take arguments and return values. Importantly,
a function always returns the same value if given the same arguments. This
helps make it possible to reason about and with functions.

## Domain and range

The 'domain' of a function is the things that the function accepts as an
argument. The 'range' of a function is the things that a function returns.
Basic data types they introduce are numbers (they don't formally
distinguish, but integers and reals), sentences, words and booleans.
Sentences and words seem to be their additions, not primitives for Scheme.
They also add, of course, that in Scheme functions can be arguments (i.e.
data).
