# Styling lists with CSS

## Defaults

If you create an ordered or unordered list on an HTML page with _no_ CSS, it will already have some style. These are of course the browser defaults. Luckily browsers share defaults, so we can expect to see these features everywhere:

+ Smaller font than the surrounding text
+ Bullet-points for unordered lists; Arabic numbers for ordered lists
+ Extra padding on the left of the list

## Making changes

However, like pretty much everything in CSS, you can change the default look of lists. For example, the numbers on ordered lists can be Roman numerals, letters or Arabic numerals. They can also appear in upper or lowercase. The bullet points on unordered lists can be solid discs, circles or squares. You can also use an image in place of the three default bullets.
