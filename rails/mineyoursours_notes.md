## Some notes from round 2 of Mine, Yours & Ours

+ Don't use all of Blueprint or 960. Just set-up a basic size and structure.
+ Devise uses non-standard class names for it's error messages.
+ Why does Heroku install *all* my gems, not just production ones?
+ Sendgrid works very nicely.
+ Forms - ugh.
